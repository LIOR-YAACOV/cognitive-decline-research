# AI-Based Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimerâ€™s Dementia through Self-Figure Drawing
This target of this project was to nuild a pipeline to analyze self-human figures that are collected from participants in a research , to predict their level of cognitive decline . For this goal, a dataset of 1600 sketches were collected from Israel, India and Thailand. Every drawing had a matching ground truth score that was achieved by giving the particiapnts a variation of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test.This test is a quetionare that is comprised of several taks to test participants' orientaton, attention , concetration etc'. The test's scores range between 0 and 30 , lower score mean poor cognitive functioning and higher scores mean better cognitive function.I treat the prediction as a regression task where my suggested deep learning model predicts a score for a given sketch and the L1 loss between the predicted score and ground truth score is used for training.
Furthermore, in this prohect I use
